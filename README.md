I was tasked with performing analysis of an election in Colorado. This election had three different candidates, and votes were collected across three counties.

## Election-Audit Summary

The script written for this project could easily be modified to be used for other elections. The main function of the script is to read a CSV file with only ballot IDs, county names, and candidate names & then count the vote totals. 

You could modify it to work with any sort of location type. One example of this would be modifying the code to perform analysis of a city election. Instead of requiring county names, we could incorporate neighborhood names or zip codes and count votes based on those criteria.

Another opportunity would be to modify this script to analyze national elections. You could also even still incorporate county level data into the analysis, while also looking at state level data.
